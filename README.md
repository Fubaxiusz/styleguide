Fubax Style Guide
=================

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This 
([google/styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)) links to the
original style guidelines from Google.

This project holds highly-modified [Java Style Guide][java] and [C/C++ Style Guide][cpp] for [Eclipse][ecp], that's easy to read and awsome.
To read more about importing style guides, visit [Eclipse Documentation][impr] site.

If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, the [XML
Document Format Style Guide][xml] may be helpful. In addition to actual style
rules, it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an existing
format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs. attributes.
